# Demo

This is the official bwNetFlow demo and should give you an introduction to your project and it's usage.

This demo is based on containerized applications and it's dependencies. For further information and configuration of the third party applications we use, please refer to their documentation too.  

## Structure

This demo is split into two parts.  
The first part is for **operators** to deploy the whole bwnetFlow Project. The second part is the **customer** specific deployment, which is meant to consume data from an existing deployment of the project.

## Getting Started

Start for operators: [operators docs](operators/README.md)  
Start for customers: [customers docs](customers/README.md)
